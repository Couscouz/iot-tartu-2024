Learning Through Practical Application
All of the projects  has reinforced my vision of learning, Starting with some theorical parts in class, and then being able to practice for few weeks in our own was a very good way of learning I feel like. BEing hands on, with bunch of materials, it gives a whole new meaning to practical sessions, where you want to experiment and try out lots of things.

Collaboration
Working together with a partner who shares the same goal (and language :)) was enjoyable. We were able to brainstorm more effectively, solve problems more quickly, and support each other when encountering difficulties. This collaboration highlighted the importance of teamwork and diverse perspectives when it comes to solve complex technical challenges, that we're not used to face.

IoT Security
As cybersecurity student, I was waiting for the security part quite some much. And indeed, this one was very interesting, by the theorical and practical aspect. I can now visualise problems and sensitives aspects of all this, security speaking.

Interconnection of IoT devices
One of the most instructive aspects of this project was seeing firsthand how interconnected IoT devices can create a automated environment. From our initial simple blinking LED experiment to the final group project, each step demonstrated how IoT devices can communicate and collaborate to improve functionality and user experience. 

Class Context
Finally, I would say that the most enjoyable and important part of this all class was the context. Being that little amount of student, with good supervisors, really made the difference. Being able to own our own materials, being able to choose what aspect to focuse on. I truly think this way of learning is very good, I learned a lot during this past months and if every class was like that it would be crazy.
