I'd really like to emphasize that this teaching principle, of teaching us the theoretical aspect through your lectures or guest speakers. Then to let us practice the contracts/projects, to reflect on them by ourselves, putting 
into practice the tools you had just explained to us, was for me a whole new vision of how to teach. I really appreciated it, because it made the lessons so much more lively, dynamic and concrete, and so much easier to 
understand. I really felt like I was learning for myself and experiencing the course rather than just listening to a teacher in front of a blackboard.

I would also like to mention the impact of the class on learning, which was simply wonderful. Indeed, most of them played the game right to the end and helped me discover other ways of thinking. Not forgetting my project 
partner, with whom we learned IOT from scratch. I really enjoyed my semester with him because we have the same vision of work and involvement in projects, and I felt really supported. Also, the principle of doing group projects 
enabled me to really get involved in teamwork. I also loved the final project with our group made up of three sub-groups, the principle resembling a real team in which everyone had a well-defined role.

One of the highlights of the course was the guest speakers, who really came to demonstrate the importance of the IOT in the world we live in, and in particular in their activities. The different aspects explained throughout 
the semester were really interesting and helped us to avoid focusing on a single method of operation or a single trend. I particularly enjoyed the subject of client connection limits, as I took part in it by using my phone as a
network.

When I chose this class I had no idea what to expect, as it didn't really fit in with my orientation and I only had a low level in Hardware. However, I'm very glad I chose this course because I learned and understood a lot of
things that will be useful to me in the future. I really think that the knowledge I've gained this semester has opened my eyes a little more to how the connected world we live in works.

Finally, I don't think this class would have been the same without the team of instructors who mentored us throughout the semester. They made and taught this class like a dose of learning in good humor. They allowed us to let
our imaginations run wild and supported us in all the projects we proposed, they were also there whenever we needed them. I really think that this way of learning was very new to me, but it was also the one that taught me the
most and the one that I enjoyed the most this semester.
