and challenges are most likely
 - Security
 - Compatibility 
 - Privacy
 - Power Consumption 
   
We can also note that most of people doesn't realize that we are surrounded by tons of IoT devices without realizing it, yet everyone are using them all day long.
    
We can imagine a scenario such as :
